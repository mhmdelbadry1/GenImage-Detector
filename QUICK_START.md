# Quick Start: Inviting Collaborators

## The Problem
❌ Asking each person: "What's your GitHub username?" one by one is tedious.

## The Solution  
✅ Share a link instead! Here's how:

### 🚀 Fastest Method (Recommended)

Run this command:
```bash
python generate_invite_link.py
```

Copy and share the **Repository URL** shown in the output.

### 📋 What People Can Do With The Link

When they click your shared link, they can:

1. **View the repository** (everyone)
2. **Fork it** to contribute via Pull Requests (everyone)
3. **Star it** to show interest (everyone)
4. **Request access** using the issue template (potential collaborators)

### 🔑 Granting Write Access

For people who need to directly edit the repository:

1. They use the link you shared to visit the repo
2. They open an [Access Request Issue](https://github.com/mhmdelbadry1/GenImage-Detector/issues/new?template=request_access.md)
3. You review their request
4. You go to: [Repository Settings > Access](https://github.com/mhmdelbadry1/GenImage-Detector/settings/access)
5. Click "Add people" and enter their username
6. They receive an invitation email automatically!

### 📱 Share These Links

**Main Repository:**
```
https://github.com/mhmdelbadry1/GenImage-Detector
```

**Request Access Form:**
```
https://github.com/mhmdelbadry1/GenImage-Detector/issues/new?template=request_access.md
```

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Share the repository link on social media, Slack, Discord, etc.
- People don't need to tell you their username - they can just open an access request issue
- You can see all pending invitations at: https://github.com/mhmdelbadry1/GenImage-Detector/settings/access

**That's it!** No more asking for usernames. Just share the link! 🎉
