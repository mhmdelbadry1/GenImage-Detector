# GenImage-Detector

A repository for detecting generated images using machine learning.

## 🎯 Want to Invite Collaborators? 

**Stop asking "What's your username?"** - Just share links instead!

👉 **[See Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)** for the fastest way to invite people.

## Collaborator Invitation

Instead of asking collaborators for their GitHub usernames one by one, you can share the repository invite link directly with them.

### Getting the Invite Link

You can use the `generate_invite_link.py` script to generate a shareable link for this repository:

```bash
python generate_invite_link.py
```

This will generate a link that you can share with potential collaborators. When they click the link, they'll be taken to GitHub where they can request access to the repository.

### Manual Method

Alternatively, you can:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Manage access"
3. Click "Invite teams or people"
4. Use the generated invite URL

### Sharing the Repository

You can also share the repository URL directly:
```
https://github.com/mhmdelbadry1/GenImage-Detector
```

Users can click "Watch" or "Star" the repository, and then you can add them as collaborators from the repository settings.
